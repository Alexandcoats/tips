      description: >-
        Returns the health of the node. A node considers itself healthy if its solid
        milestone is at most two delta away from the latest known milestone, has at
        least one ongoing gossip stream and the latest known milestone is newer
        than 5 minutes. This information might be useful for load-balancing
        or uptime monitoring.
